# LeetCode - 238. Product of Array Except Self
## Description
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
``` 

### Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 105
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer = 1
        result = []
        z = nums.count(0)

        for i in nums:
            if i!=0:
                answer *= i

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]!=0:
                if z>0:
                    result.append(0)
                    continue
                if z==0:
                    result.append(answer//nums[i])
                    continue
            else:
                if z==1:
                    result.append(answer)
                else:
                    result.append(0)
        return result
```
