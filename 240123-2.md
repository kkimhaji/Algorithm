# LeetCode - Sort an Array (912)
## Problems
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
```

###vExample 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
 
```
Constraints:

`1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
`-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104`

```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        l = len(nums)
        minnum = min(nums)
        maxnum = max(nums)
        m = maxnum-minnum

        arr= [0] * (maxnum - minnum+1)
        
        for i in nums:
            arr[i-minnum] += 1
        
        answer = []
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            for j in range(arr[i]):
                answer.append(i + minnum)
        
        return answer

```
