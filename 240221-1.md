# LeetCode - 64. Minimum Path Sum
## Description
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```

### Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                if i==0 and j==0:
                    continue
                elif i==0:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i][j-1]
                elif j == 0:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i-1][j]
                else:
                    grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
        
        return grid[-1][-1]
```
