# LeetCode - 63. Unique Paths II
## Description
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

### Example 1:

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

### Example 2:
![image](https://github.com/kkimhaji/Algorithm/assets/55172514/43c12d42-f9c8-49ce-b00b-0555f17dd533)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- m == obstacleGrid.length
- n == obstacleGrid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.


## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(obstacleGrid[0]))] for _ in range(len(obstacleGrid)) ]
        for i in range(len(obstacleGrid)):
            for j in range(len(obstacleGrid[i])):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    continue
                if i==0 and j==0:
                    dp[i][j] =1
                    continue
                elif i==0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
                elif j==0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1]
        
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
